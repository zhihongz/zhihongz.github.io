I’m a Ph.D. Student at the Broadband and Digital Media Lab (<a href='http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>BBNC</a>), Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Jinli Suo.

I received my B.Eng. degree from the School of Electronics Engineering, Xidian University, Xi’an, China, in 2019.

My research interests include computational imaging, machine learning, and computer vision. Specifically, I focus on high-throughput low-bandwidth computational imaging and corresponding low-level and high-level vision tasks.

Current research interests: snapshot compressive imaging, high-speed imaging, low-light imaging, deblurring, denoising, etc.
