I am a research engineer specializing in computational photography and computer vision. My goal is to develop comprehensive sensing-processing-tasking frameworks that enhance the performance of both low-level and high-level vision tasks. This involves the co-design of front-end imaging systems and backend vision algorithms.

I earned my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>Tsinghua University</a> in 2024, under the guidance of Prof. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e4lel8QAAAAJ'>Jinli Suo</a>. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. in Electronics and Information Engineering from <a href='https://www.xidian.edu.cn/'>Xidian University</a> in 2019.

My current interests include coded aperture/exposure imaging, low-light imaging, high-speed imaging, deblurring, denoising, event cameras, and diffusion models.
